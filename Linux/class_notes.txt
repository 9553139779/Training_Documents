Operating System :::

	Fundamentals of Linux Operating System 
	
		- Windows 
		- Mac 
		- Linux 
		
	Linux Operating System 
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 
			
		- Command Line Interface 
		
		- Linux Distributions :::
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora
				
			Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
													
				- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
				
					- TO work with Package Manager :
						- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
							- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
				
	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :

			Packages can be managed based on the Distributions 
			
		
		- Package Management :::

			- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
		
				- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
				- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
												yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
												
			- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
			
				- TO work with Package Manager :
					- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
						- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		
			- To Install any tool/package :
			
				Install Pre-requisites	
				Install Actual Tool
				Post Installation Actions				
		
					Eg.: Tomcat :::: 
					
						Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
						
						Install Actual Tool				===> Installed Tomcat 
						
						Post Installation Actions		===> Started Tomcat 
		
		
			How to Install/Manage Packages ? :::
			
			- Elevate the Access to Root Level
				sudo -i 					# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
				
			- apt update 					# Used update the default packages
			
			- apt install openjdk-11		# Install Java Package 
			
			- Linux Application Service(nginx/Jenkins) 		
			
				- Start / Stop / Enable / Status / restart 
				
				systemctl status nginx 
				
				systemctl start nginx
				
				systemctl stop nginx
				
				systemctl enable nginx		# Used to define the service as as start up service
		
				systemctl disable nginx		# Used to remove the service from the start-up task list
				
				systemctl restart nginx 
				
			- apt install git				# Install git 
			
			- apt remove git 				# Uninstall git 
			
			- apt upgrade git 				# Used to upgrade git
		
		
			Package :
			
				- Stand-alone Tool			Eg.: git
				- Service					Eg.: tomcat/nginx/jenkins/docker 
		
			which nginx						# Used to get the path of installation ?
			
			which get 
			
			git --version
		
		
		
		- File Management 	

			- sudo -i 
			
			- exit 				# Logout from current linux user 

			- ls 				# Is to List the files and Directories 
			
			- ll 				# Long Listing - to get the full property of the directory

SHELL Scripting :::

	Process Automation using shell scripting!
	
	Fundamentals of Shell Scripting!
	
	Scripting Languages ?
		- Are used to perform some process automation/validations
		- Light-weight 
		- Eg.: java scripts / shell scripts / yaml script / groovy / python 
			(vs)
	Progamming Language ?
		- Are used to create some business applications 
		- Huge Collection of Programming components
		- Eg.: Java/.Net Framework/Python/Ruby/Cobol/C
		
	
	Shell Scripting Language :
	
		- Shell Scripting is a collection shell commands 
		- Shell Script file should be saved as *.sh (Extention should be .sh)
		
	Install git ?
	
		Install all these packages in 200 VMs :::
	
		apt install openjdk11 -y
		apt install git -y 
		apt install maven -y 
		apt install docker.io -y
		apt install ansible -y 
		
		Shell Script :
		
installbuildtools.sh 
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt install openjdk11 -y
sudo apt install git -y 
sudo apt install maven -y 
sudo apt install docker.io -y
#sudo apt install ansible -y 

save the script as installbuildtools.sh 

/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ls 
installbuildtools.sh	

/home/devopsadmin/scripts/$ ./installbuildtools.sh		# Run the Shell Script!

Any Scripting/Programming Languages :::


	Data !!!
	
	Variable_Name to store data 
	Type of Data - Data Type !
	
	var1 = 10001 
	var2 = "asdfasdf"
	var3 = 'a'
	
	Stud_Number = '101'	

	
	Validation / Conditional Statements 
	
		IF Conditions
		SwitchCase Statements
		
	Stud_Number[5];		# Array Variable 		
		==> {1,2,3,4,5}
		
	Looping Contructs 
	
		- for loop
		- while loop
		- do-while 
	
	Functions 
		- String function
		
	Keyword 
	
	File Handling :
	
		- Create/Read/Write/Update/Delete the Files
