Operating System :::

	Fundamentals of Linux Operating System 
	
		- Windows 
		- Mac 
		- Linux 
		
	Linux Operating System 
		- Open-Source 
		- Is Secured 
		- Linux OS was created based on the Unix Operating System 
		- Is an interface between the user applications and underlying Hardware.
		- Linux OS is based on the Command User Interface
		- Core of Linux OS is called kernel!
			Components of Linux OS Architecture
				- Networking 
				- Storage 
				- IPC - Inter Process Communication
				- User Management 
				- Security Management 
				- Control Groups 
				- Namespace 
				- Process 
			
		- Command Line Interface 
		
		- Linux Distributions :::
		
			- Flavors of Linux OS 
			
				- Centos / RHEL 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 
				- Fedora
				
			Package Management - Package Managers :::
				- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
			
					- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
					- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
					- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
													yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
													
				- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
				
					- TO work with Package Manager :
						- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
							- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
				
	Learn Linux on DevOps Perspectives :
	
		What the Role of DevOps Team/Engineer on Linux.
		
			- All the DevOps Tools can be installed and Managed in Linux Machines 
		
		What is your role here ????
		
			- Install all the DevOps Tools 
			- Package Management - Periodically Upgrade/Uninstall - Backup of the Tools
			- Managing Remote Servers 
				- Client Server Architecture 
				- Server1 (VM)
					- Client1,2,3,4,5,6
					
			- As a DevOps Team we can Manage the Linux Machines
			
				- Package Management 
				- File Management 
				- User Management 
				- Access Management 
				- Remote Servers Management 
				- Process Automation(Shell Scripting)
				
				
	Working with Linux ::

		- Basic Linux Commands 
		
			Package Manager - apt/yum/dnf ==> can e executed as a root user.
			
		- Linux Distributions 
				
			Packages can be managed based on the Distributions 
			
		
		- Package Management :::

			- Package Managers are used to install/Uninstall/Upgrade the Packages/software 
		
				- Centos / RHEL 		===> 	yum package Manager 
				- Debian / Ubuntu 		===>	apt/apt-get package Manager 
				- Fedora				===>	dnf (Latest Version of Fedora)
												yum (Previous Version of Fedora)
												
			- Package Managers can be executed only by the root user on Linux
			
				- TO work with Package Manager :
					- Elevate the Access to Root Level 
						- sudo -i			# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
		
			- To Install any tool/package :
			
				Install Pre-requisites	
				Install Actual Tool
				Post Installation Actions				
		
					Eg.: Tomcat :::: 
					
						Install Pre-requisites			===> jdk 
						
						Install Actual Tool				===> Installed Tomcat 
						
						Post Installation Actions		===> Started Tomcat 
		
		
			How to Install/Manage Packages ? :::
			
			- Elevate the Access to Root Level
				sudo -i 					# This Command is used to elevate the access to root level
				
			- apt update 					# Used update the default packages
			
			- apt install openjdk-11		# Install Java Package 
			
			- Linux Application Service(nginx/Jenkins) 		
			
				- Start / Stop / Enable / Status / restart 
				
				systemctl status nginx 
				
				systemctl start nginx
				
				systemctl stop nginx
				
				systemctl enable nginx		# Used to define the service as as start up service
		
				systemctl disable nginx		# Used to remove the service from the start-up task list
				
				systemctl restart nginx 
				
			- apt install git				# Install git 
			
			- apt remove git 				# Uninstall git 
			
			- apt upgrade git 				# Used to upgrade git
		
		
			Package :
			
				- Stand-alone Tool			Eg.: git
				- Service					Eg.: tomcat/nginx/jenkins/docker 
		
			which nginx						# Used to get the path of installation ?
			
			which get 
			
			git --version
		
		
		
		- File Management 	

			- sudo -i 
			
			- exit 				# Logout from current linux user 

			- ls 				# Is to List the files and Directories 
			
			- ll 				# Long Listing - to get the full property of the directory
			
			- ls -a				# List All(List all the files, including hidden files and directories)
			
			
			Navigate to Directories :::

				- pwd				# Get the Present Working Directory

				- cd				# Change Directory
				
				- cd <dir_name> 	# Change to a specific directory				
				
				- cd /				# This command will take to the root directory			
			
				- cd ~				# This command will take to the home directory(Default Directory) of the specific linux user
									Eg.: 	ubuntu 	===> /home/ubuntu 
		
									root	===> /root
Next :::		
			
			- Create a Directory(Folder)
				- Is a collection of files and directories
				
			- Create a File 
			
			- Edit the files 
			
			- Delete the files

			- Delete the Directories 
			
			- Copy the files/Directories 
			
			- Move the Files/Directories 
			
			- Rename the Files/Directories 
			
			Create File Access Control

			- Create a Directory(Folder)
				- Is a collection of files and directories
				
			- Create a File 
			
			- Edit the files 
				- Using File Editors - (vi editor / nano editor)
			
			- Delete the files

			- Delete the Directories 
			
			- Copy the files/Directories 
			
			- Move the Files/Directories 
			
			- Rename the Files/Directories

			- exit 				# Logout from current linux user 

			- ls 				# Is to List the files and Directories 
			
			- ll 				# Long Listing - to get the full property of the directory
			
			- ls -a				# List All(List all the files, including hidden files and directories)

				- cd				# Change Directory
				
				- cd <dir_name> 	# Change to a specific directory				
				
				- cd /				# This command will take to the root directory

									Eg.: 	ubuntu 	===> /home/ubuntu 
		
									root	===> /root				
	
			
				clear 				# Clear the Screen
				
				
				mkdir <dir_name>	# used to Creae Directory 
				
				cd <dir_name>		# Change the directory
				
				cd ..				# Take the control back to previous directory
	
			Create Files :
				
					- touch <file_name>		# used to create an empty file 
					
					- echo "Record1" >> <file_name>		# To create a file with a record
					
					- echo "rec1" >> file1.txt	
							# Used to add more record to the specific file 
							
					- echo "rec1" > file1.txt	
							# Used to replace the file content with the new record 
							
					- vi <file_name>		# Used to Create / edit a file using vi editor
					
					
			Read the file content :
				
					cat <file_name>			# Read the Content of a file
					
					
					- vi <file_name>		# Used to Create / edit a file using vi editor

					Eg.: 
					
						vi file1.txt 
						
							press i 		# goto insert mode 
							
							#type some contents
							#type some contents				
							
							press esc :wq	# Save and Exit from a file 
	
							press esc :q!	# Exit from a file without saving it. 
							
			Rename File or Directory :::
					
						mv file1 file-new-name
						
						mv dir1 new-dir-name
						
			Delete a file or Directory :::
					
						rm <file_Name>			# Remove File  
						
						rm file1.txt 
						
						rm *.txt
						
						rm -r <dir_Name>		# Remove Directory
						
						rm -rf <dir_name>		# Forceful Deletion of Directory
						
						
			Copy files from one directory to another :::
			
						cp <source_file> <Target_Dir>	# Used to copy a file to target folder 
						
						mv <source_file> <Target_Dir>	# Used to move a file to target folder 
			
						mv file1 file-new-name			# To Rename a file
						mv dir1 new-dir-name			# To Rename a directory
						
						
			File Access ::::
			
				Who can Access the file ?
				
					- By Default Owner will have complete access.
